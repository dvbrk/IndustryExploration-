  <h1>Industry exploration</h1>
  <p>The company I will be choosing for my industry exploration is Valve. Valve is a Company that created games and created Steam, which is one of the leading gaming platforms that provide content creators for users that want to get their media onto the platform. It is essentially Googleâ€™s play store but specifically dedicated for games and software.Valve itself is a big company. It is reported to have over 250+ employees and considered one of the most profitable company per employee in the US.   <a href="#" data-hover-content="<div class='hover-content'>

    </div>"> </a>For me, I use steam to play games, chat with users, and sculpt 3d models to export to external software using ZBrush, which then I could export directly to WEBGL file. But what I find enthralling about valve is the way they can detect cheaters from breaking online multiplayer platforms. The other thing that is fascinating is the steam client and the amount of traffic they must handle during big summer sales.  <a href="#" data-hover-content="<div class='hover-content'>
  
  
    </div>"></a> I think what would be challenging about working for Valve is probably amount of stress and pressure the database and web application engineers that they need to handle during the seasonal sales. When users are seeing the webpage on the client down, it results to an influx of users submitting requests all at once.  <a href="#" data-hover-content="<div class='hover-content'>
